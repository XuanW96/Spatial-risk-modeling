# Spatial-risk-modeling: the case of crime
ZIXUAN WANG

In this report, the goal is to build on the spatial risk predictive model and create a tool that Police can use to more efficiently allocate their limited resources. Our hypothesis is that risk is a function of exposure to the kinds of environmental variables we think may be associated with crime. 
Think not only about ‘risk factors’ but about ‘protective factors’ as well. 
Examples of the latter might include churches and recreation centers.
